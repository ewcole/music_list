# music_list
An application to track the music you are playing

This is meant for the player who needs to keep track of the music he can play so as to keep his repertoire fresh.  The chief objectives are to provide a rotated list of pieces for him to work on in his daily practice, and lists of music for special occasions.

The project is built using (http://www.grails.org)[Grails], and is meant to be deployed to a Java EE servlet container.
